Report alerts for one single rule. Maybe use custom output templates to generate a custom report. See Vale documentation - JSON output of checks and Vale documentation - --output. Consider aggregating alerts to identify the most common. Examine the report to distinguish legit alerts from false positives. Use the curated list of false positives to report an issue. For example, for the Spelling rule, create a report containing the list of all words reported by the Spelling rule, and count their occurrences. Use that list to differentiate false positives from legit errors. Use the curated list to report an issue.

In the .github/workflows/ folder of your project repository, create a YAML file called vale.yml. Tip: You can also click Actions and use the GitHub Actions wizard to initialize the vale.yml file and validate your configuration. Add the following configuration to the .github/workflows/vale.yml file: name: Linting with Vale on: - pull_request jobs: vale: name: Linting with Vale runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - name: Checkout uses: actions/checkout@v2 - name: Vale Linter uses: errata-ai/vale-action@reviewdog with: fail_on_error: false vale_flags: \"--no-exit\" files: __onlyModified onlyAnnotateModifiedLines: true env: # Required, set by GitHub actions automatically: # https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#about-the-github_token-secret GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}} Optional: Change the default configuration to suit the requirements of your project. For example, if you want to block PR merges when Vale errors exist, set fail_on_error to true. Commit and push the GitHub Action to the main branch of your GitHub repository and rebase your other branches. Verification To test your GitHub Action, change or add some content files and submit a pull request to the main docs branch. Vale will run and report an expandable status summary in the PR.","title":"Integrating Vale into your Git workflow by using a GitHub Action","component":"docs","version":"main","name":"using-vale-github-action","url":"/docs/main/user-guide/using-vale-github-action/","titles":[]},"46":{"id":46,"text":"Consider using Vale in your IDE when: You want a direct feedback in your editor.
